<p>I am actually a cat in disguise. Disguising as a human was the only way that Girls Who Code would accept me into the program. It is also the reason that I am at Groupon. I am the Groupon Cat. People thought that I was just a story, but I showed them. My interests include being a cat, eating food, watching Netflix, and trying to code with my little cat hands. People don't usually believe it when I tell them I'm a cat, but it's okay. I also enjoy tea, playing old video games, and long walks on the beach.     </p>

<p>I attend Chicago Academy High School in my human alter ego. There, I am a part of several organizations and play softball. I hold positions on the Student Council, which is my stepping stone to make cats the dominant race on Earth. I am also part of the Student in Action, the biggest leadership group in the city, allowing for my training as a dictator to continue. My acceptance to the University of Chicago will secure the ruling of cats and will crush the Earthlings.</p>

<p>To go to college, my incredibly intelligent cat brain has hatched a plan: attend the Girls Who Code Immersion Program, be a Chicago Scholar, and use my wits to charm the whiskers of the college admissions board (they also happen to be cats). After college, I plan on using my reputation as the Groupon cat to exploit this multi-billion dollar company that is rightfully mine, and then take over the world with my fellow felines following me.  </p>
