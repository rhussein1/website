{"name":"The Secret Life of Reem ","tagline":"","body":"![](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/13560881/9009265/b05247a0-3765-11e5-8d7b-49f9f2393cce.jpg)\r\nI am actually a cat in disguise. Disguising as a human was the only way that Girls Who Code would accept me into the program. My interests include being a cat, eating food, watching Netflix, and trying to code with my little cat hands. People don't usually believe it when I tell them I'm a cat, but it's okay. I also enjoy tea, playing old video games, and long walks on the beach. \t\r\n\r\nI attend Chicago Academy High School in my human alter ego. There, I am a part of several organizations and play softball. I hold positions on the Student Council, which is my stepping stone to make cats the dominant race on Earth. I am also part of the Student in Action, the biggest leadership group in the city, allowing for my training as a dictator to continue. My acceptance to the University of Chicago will secure the ruling of cats and will crush the Earthlings.\r\n\r\nTo go to college, my incredibly intelligent cat brain has hatched a plan: attend the Girls Who Code Immersion Program, be a Chicago Scholar, and use my wits to charm the whiskers of the college admissions board (they also happen to be cats).","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
